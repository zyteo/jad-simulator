<!-- OSRS Jad simulator on browser -->
<!-- ZY, 8 Aug 2022 -->

Died on first try, got it on second try AND I'M NEVER GOING BACK
# Welcome to OSRS Jad simulator. No download required, available on browser, and it's free!

## For you to practice juggling prayer flicking, food eating and weapon changing.

Not the most beautiful app out there, but inspired by the jad simulator from runeapps (thanks for the firecape!) and decided to make an osrs browser version since there isn't any on the market (that I know of).

Only healthbar above character shows hitpoints changes. Orbs on the screen are just for show.

Best to use on a browser. Not mobile-compatible, does not feature responsive design yet.

I think github's starstruck badge is kinda cute.
You can thank me by "Star"ing this repo, so that it helps contribute to my starstruck badge.

## Planning and Development Process

```
Timeline

- 8 Aug 2022: Started planning for the app. Created variables needed for app.
Tried out width and height in % to attempt for a responsive design but doesn't work well.
Scaling will be off depending on how user adjusts screen.
Will decide to go on with fixed width/height using pixels for now.
Set up the different divs for the app.
Experimented A LOT with CSS styling.
