<!-- OSRS Jad simulator on browser -->
<!-- ZY, 8 Aug 2022 -->

Died on first try, got it on second try AND I'M NEVER GOING BACK

# Welcome to OSRS Jad simulator. No download required, available on browser, and it's free!

## For you to practice juggling prayer flicking, food eating and weapon changing.

Not the most beautiful app out there, but inspired by the jad simulator from runeapps (thanks for the firecape!) and decided to make an osrs browser version since there isn't any on the market (that I know of).

Only healthbar above character shows hitpoints changes. Orbs on the screen are just for show.

Best to use on a browser. Not mobile-compatible, does not feature responsive design yet.

I think github's starstruck badge is kinda cute.
You can thank me by "Star"ing this repo, so that it helps contribute to my starstruck badge.

- [ ] 16 Stars - I'll upload the video of my first fight with Jad.
- [ ] 128 Stars - I'll upload the video of my second fight with Jad.
- [ ] 512 Stars - I'll say a big thank you.

## Planning and Development Process

```
Timeline

- 8 Aug 2022: Started planning for the app. Created variables needed for app.
Tried out width and height in % to attempt for a responsive design but doesn't work well.
Scaling will be off depending on how user adjusts screen.
Will decide to go on with fixed width/height using pixels for now.
Set up the different divs for the app.
Experimented A LOT with CSS styling.
Took relevant screenshots in game to be used as images for the app.
Used photoshop to adjust images.

- 9 Aug 2022: Adjusted CSS for images.
Added the light yellow prayer circle for user to select prayer.
Added the prayer sprite from osrswiki for the overhead prayer.
Added the item sprites for saradomin brew, super restore and rune crossbow.
Adjusted CSS for the item inventory.

- 10 Aug 2022: Added hotkey to change inventory.
Added function to 'drink' potions in inventory.
Added player sprite for blowpipe / crossbow.

- 11 Aug 2022: Added healthpoints green / red bar.
Converted my mp4 to gif and added the gif into the app.
Realised autoplaying mp3 isn't as straightforward as browsers have their own limitations.

- 12 Aug 2022: Replaced jad gif and edited video with online app. Much better quality!
Added audio tag in html, browser dependent compatability so I will just include audio anyways.
Set function to rotate jad attacks randomly.
Changed F-keys to 3 and 4 instead of F3 and F4 since browser pop up inteferes.
Adjust styling for app to look more decent.
Adjusted start button function - restock inventory.
Deployed app successfully!

- 13 Aug 2022: Edited text slightly and shifted jad attack timer up.
Made repo public.
